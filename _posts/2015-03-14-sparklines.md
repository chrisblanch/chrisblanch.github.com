Two of the best designed, single-purpose apps on my iPhone are [DarkSky](http://darksky.com), an ultra-localized weather app, and [btcReport](http://btcreport.net), a simple bitcoin price tracker.

Tons of whitespace. Huge typography. Simple settings. These designers are true believers, for sure.

But like many disciples of divine leaders (see: Jesus, Edward Tufte), they have taken the teachings out of context (see: , Sparklines), and committed horrible atrocities (see: The Spanish Inquisition, suboptimal data-visualization).

The sparkline is favored for the amount of information it can convey at a glance. Maximum information with Minimum pixels + minimum effort.
