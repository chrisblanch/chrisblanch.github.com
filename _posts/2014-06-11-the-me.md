I've read it a hundred times.

> The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.<br>
> <cite>-- Franklin Delano Roosevelt, 1933</cite>

In the years since, the political meaning has become all too obvious:  
[Joseph McCarthy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_McCarthy), [Lyndon Johnson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDTBnsqxZ3k), [George W. Bush](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Rove)

But I've recently come to realize a personal implication.

##How often are you truly fearful?

Once every month? Year? Decade?

I rarely feel fear. My average day is comfortable to the point of absurdity. Sometimes the line for a pour-over coffee is really long and an uber across town is surging at 3x.

I'm afflicted.

## The fear of fear is winning.

If you don't feel fear, and feel it regularly, you're suffering too. It's an insidious afflication. It lurks beneath the surface of your mind. You don't know it's happening, but like a fly on the wall, you watch yourself give in.

"That sounds fun, but work was rough today."

"Sure, I'll have one more."

"Next time."

It begins now. I'm declaring war on the fear of fear.

And there's only one way I'll know if I'm winning.

## Fear itself.
