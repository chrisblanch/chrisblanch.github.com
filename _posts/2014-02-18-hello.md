Hello internet.

I'm not sure what this here blog will become. There's a real possibility I never make it a priority and it dies the slow death of neglect. But that would be a damned shame &dash; not because my thoughts could bring any value to the world, but because the world could bring so much value to my thoughts.

If I stick with it though, I could:

**1. Acheive Personal and Social Accountability**

Everyone is an expert on everything. (link). Putting my reputation, if not my money, where my mouth is the only way I can think of back-testing one's expertise.

A couple blog posts I'm glad I didn't publish for all to see:
- Backed by Facebook and Google, html will defaeat native apps on iOS
- The switching costs of a the leading search engine are far lower than a the leading social network, and the markets would eventually reflect as much

**2. Explore, Refine, and Challenge Beliefs**



**3. Cultivate a habit of creating**

Being a perfectionist and an amateur can be a tough combination. The trick is internalize the Minimum Viable Product every step of the way.

***Awesome quotes***
