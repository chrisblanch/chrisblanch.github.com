<img src="/images/presidio_portrait.png" height="80" class="selfie" style="border-radius: 4px; float:left; margin: 2px .9em 0 0;"/> I'm Chris Blanchard. I'm a novice writer, an intermediate mountaineer, and a future conservationist. I was born in Pittsburgh, went to Duke, and live in San Francisco.
I'm a self-taught programmer turned Product Manager at [Zignal Labs](http://zignallabs.com/).

I believe that [software is eating the world](http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460), and it's on us to decide how.
<br><br>
I get a little too excited by topographic maps, trying hard at games, and bourbon -- among other things.

Welcome to my slice of internet. If you made it this far, [say hi on twitter.](http://twitter.com/chrisblanch)
