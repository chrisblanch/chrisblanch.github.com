I'm Chris Blanchard, an internet generalist living and working in San Francisco.
I was raised in Pittsburgh and studied at Duke University.
<br><br>
I joined [Zignal Labs](http://zignallabs.com/) in 2012 as a frontend engineer and now serve as a Product Manager.
<br><br>
When I get away from screens, I try to run and bike on trails, walk up mountains, and sometimes ski down them.
<br><br>
If you made it this far, you're probably a swell human. [Send me an email and say hi](mailto:c@chrisblanch.com).
