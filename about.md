I'm Chris Blanchard. I'm a former runner, a self-taught programmer, and an aspiring conservationist.
I'm from Pittsburgh. I went to Duke. I live and work in San Francisco.
<br><br>
I joined [Zignal Labs](http://zignallabs.com/) in 2012 as a frontend engineer and now serve as a Product Manager. For fun, I'm big into trying too hard at things - biking, mountaineering, board games.
<br><br>
I believe in the transformative power of technology, I think the internet is in its early adolesence at best, and that software will continue eating the world. I also want to move to a remote cabin in the Canadian Rockies. It's confusing.
<br><br>
Welcome to my personal slice of internet. If you made it this far, [say hello, weirdo.](mailto:c@chrisblanch.com)
