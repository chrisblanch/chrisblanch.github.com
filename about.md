<img src="/images/face_pic.png" height="84" class="selfie" style="border-radius: 4px; float:left; margin: 0 1em 0 0;"/> I'm Chris Blanchard. I'm a former runner, a novice mountaineer, and an aspiring conservationist. I was born in Pittsburgh, went to Duke, and live in San Francisco.
I'm a self-taught programmer turned Product Manager at [Zignal Labs](http://zignallabs.com/).

I believe that [software is eating the world](http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460), and it's on us to decide how.
<br><br>
I get a little too excited by topographic maps, board games, and bourbon, among other things.
